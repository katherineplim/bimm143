```{r}
db <- read.csv("DataExportSummary.csv")
db
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
# This function gets the sum of a column from the db file.
sum_comma <- function(x) {
  result <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
  result
}
```

For X-ray:

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

For EM:

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB.

Skipped.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Water molecules are extremely small so are represented by only one atom (oxygen). The structure is too low resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution in order to see H atoms.

> Q5: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

The residue number is HOH308.

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand.

# Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Read an ADK structure:

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a predication of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis): 

```{r}
# Perform flexibility predication
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" of the motion for viewing in MolStar.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```
